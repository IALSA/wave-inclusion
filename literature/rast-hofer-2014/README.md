## Paragraphs
### Intro  
* 1. We need longitudinal data to do developmental science

* 2. For that we use longitudinal model, like a bivariate growth curve model. 

* 3. Power to detect variance of variables over time, but not how rate of change (linear slopes) varies across individuals.  

* 4. Unmodifiable and modifiable features of longitudinal studies.   
	- Unmodifiable:   
		- variability of change over time (i.e., individual differences in slope )  
		- correlation between changes over time (i.e., covariance of slopes)   
		- measurement error variance   
	- Modifiable:  
		- sample size (N)  
		- number of measurements  
		- spacing of measurements   
		- study span/duration  
		
	We can distinguish another type of variables, the one under control of the modeler (i.e., number of waves to include into the analytic data)	

* 5. GOAL: 	Using modifiable features of longitudinal study, how to optimize power for detecting individual differences in and among rates of change? 


## Background Notes:  
- reliability of individual growth is dependent on the magnitudie of interindividual heterogenity in growth, the size of the measurement error variance, and SST which is dependent on the number of waves, the spacing or interval betweeen these waves, and the total duration of the study. Quote from Willett (1989) "with sufficient waves added, the influence of fallible measurement rapidly dwindles to zero".  
- Growth curve reliability is an index of measurement reliability but does not directly provide information on the ability to detect slope variances.  

Aim:  
- To understand the effect of critical design parameters on power to detect individual differences in growth.   

Results   
- In their sample of longitudinal studies there were some studies (those with more waves and longer follow-up) where quadratic trends were indicated.   
- With shorter three wave designs (OCTO and LASA) number of participants required to obtain sufficient power was much larger compared to the same studies with five waves that covered four to seven more years (analysed later?).
