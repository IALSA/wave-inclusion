[Longitudinal design considerations to optimize power to detect variances and covariances among rates of change: Simulation results based on actual longitudinal studies](https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&q=Longitudinal+design+considerations+to+optimize+power+to+detect+variances+and+covariances+among+rates+of+change%3A+Simulation+results+based+on+actual+longitudinal+studies.&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=).

* 1. We need longitudinal data to do developmental science

* 2. For that we use longitudinal model, like a bivariate growth curve model. 

* 3. Power to detect variance of variables over time, but not how rate of change (linear slopes) varies across individuals.  

* 4. Unmodifiable and modifiable features of longitudinal studies.   
	- Unmodifiable:   
		- variability of change over time (i.e., individual differences in slope )  
		- correlation between changes over time (i.e., covariance of slopes)   
		- measurement error variance   
	- Modifiable:  
		- sample size (N)  
		- number of measurements  
		- spacing of measurements   
		- study span/duration  
		
	We can distinguish another type of variables, the one under control of the modeler (i.e., number of waves to include into the analytic data)	

* 5. GOAL: 	Using modifiable features of longitudinal study, how to optimize power for detecting individual differences in and among rates of change?
