Background Notes:
- reliability of individual growth is dependent on the magnitudie of interindividual heterogenity in growth, the size of the measurement error variance, and SST which is dependent on the number of waves, the spacing or interval betweeen these waves, and the total duration of the study. Quote from Willett (1989) "with sufficient waves added, the influence of fallible measurement rapidly dwindles to zero".
- Growth curve reliability is an index of measurement reliability but does not directly provide information on the ability to detect slope variances.

Aim:
- To understand the effect of critical design parameters on power to detect individual differences in growth. 

Results
- In their sample of longitudinal studies there were some studies (those with more waves and longer follow-up) where quadratic trends were indicated.
- With shorter three wave designs (OCTO and LASA) number of participants required to obtain sufficient power was much larger compared to the same studies with five waves that covered four to seven more years (analysed later?).
